# RAID Calculator
raidcalculator.py is a simple tool written in Python to help calculate RAID array capacities, and error.


## Installation and Usage


### Installation
No dependencies are required, only Python 3.

 Simply just download or clone the repository, and run main.py.


### Usage
RAID Calculator is compatible with...
* RAID 0
* RAID 1
* RAID 10
* RAID 5
* RAID 50
* RAID 6
* RAID 60

When inputting RAID type, only input the number *(i.e input 6 for RAID 6)*


## Project Intentions
### Goal
The end goal for this program is to have a simple, privacy respecting website with the purpose of calculating RAID arrays. 

I am writing the CLI element first as it makes more sense, this will be updated in the coming months when the website is launched, and a separate repository will be made.

### New Features
- [ ] ZFS Compatibility
- [ ] New UX, less strict input handling
- [ ] Web Interface
